# Security Rules

- Never commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials to the repository
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in application output
- Always validate and sanitize external input before use
- Prefer parameterized queries over string interpolation for data access
- Use HTTPS for all external network requests
