# Session Config Reference

This repository demonstrates every Claude Code configuration surface.
Use it as a starting point for your own session-config repos.

## Conventions

- Write clean, well-documented code
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Commands

```bash
# Lint markdown files
markdownlint **/*.md

# Run a placeholder test suite
echo "All checks passed"
```

## Project Context

This is a reference/template repository. There is no application code — only
Claude Code configuration files. When working here, focus on keeping the
config examples accurate, minimal, and well-commented.
